<h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, and welcome to Konga's Crochet I'm Joy Konga, a passionate crocheter and lover of all things handmade. My crochet journey began in primary school, where I was first introduced to the art of crochet by my amazing mother. She patiently taught me the basics such as creating loops and stitches.</p>

        <p>Growing up, crochet quickly became more than just a hobbyâ€”it was a way to express myself creatively and connect with others. My mom and I would spend countless hours together, crafting everything from cozy blankets to colorful scarves. .</p>
        <p>As I honed my skills, I began exploring different techniques and styles, inspired by the vibrant world of crochet fashion. From bohemian tops to intricate lace shawls, I've always been fascinated by the endless possibilities that a simple ball of yarn can offer. Over the years, I've developed my own unique style, blending classic patterns with modern twists to create pieces that are both timeless and trendy.</p>
        <p> I aim to share my skills learned throughout by creating new and inspired patterns.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my blog! Feel free to explore, connect. Let's create something beautiful together!</p>
